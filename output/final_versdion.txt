"The Gates of Morning"
Chapter 1
The Canoe Builder

Dick stood on a ledge of coral, gazing southward.

Behind him, the outer sea roared with crashing waves, and the spindrift danced on the wind. In front of him stretched an ocean calm as a lake—vast, blue, and scattered with fishing gulls. This immense lagoon, enclosed by a forty-mile ring of coral, was a sea unto itself. Stormy under heavy winds and serene under soft breezes, it was his now—he had arrived only yesterday.

Along the sunlit beach, people bustled under the scorching sun. Women, children, and youths fished with nets, played games, or tended the paraka patches. These were his people now, the tribe to which he belonged. His were the canoes pulled up on the sand, and his were the now-empty shelters where war canoes once rested on wooden rollers.

As he shifted his gaze from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown creased his brow. He turned away from the tranquil waters and faced the northern sea, where, far beyond the visible horizon, lay an island called Palm Tree—an island as beautiful as a dream, yet haunted by danger.

Nearby, little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral, watching him. Though young and innocent, Tari knew that the men of Karolin were gone, taken by war, leaving only the women and children behind.

Tari looked up at Dick with wide eyes, filled with curiosity and awe. He had heard the stories—the ones whispered about Palm Tree and the devils said to inhabit it. He didn’t fully understand them, but he sensed the fear they carried.

This chapter introduces Dick, a newcomer to the island of Karolin, where he finds himself in a leadership role among the remnants of a once-thriving tribe. As he reflects on the peaceful beauty of the lagoon and the looming threat from beyond the sea, a sense of responsibility and unease grows within him.

What challenges await him? What secrets lie on the horizon?
